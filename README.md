# Lockout

Lockout is a simple Android quick setting tile that allows you to disable the fingerprint scanner on you device until the next unlock.
It can be used from the lockscreen to insure it is as quick as possible to use.

This was deeply inspired by the [iOS SOS Mode](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/disable-touch-id-face-id-ios-11/) that quickly disables biometrics there. Also thanks to [andyooo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7imzv1/tip_quickly_disable_fingerprint_unlock_and/) for informing me that it is posible on Android.
